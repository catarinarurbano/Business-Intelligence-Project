# BI Project

## Objective
Deliver an end-to-end Self Service BI solution to support strategic, tactical and operational business decisions.

### Source Data 
Each group had to choose a business/organizational problem.  The source data had to contain, at the very minimum, the following features:

- Some sort of transactional records that can represent quantifiable facts. Also, transactional data that has regular, “well-behaved” quantitative measures, that is, data that keeps track of quantities that are easy to understand can be easily operated on (summed, averaged, etc.) and that display a reasonably regular pattern across time.
- Enough attributes (characteristics) so that we can extract at least five dimensions from the source data. Also, select data that has viable options in terms of dimensional analysis. The characteristics should provide the ability to set up different hierarchies in the different dimensions.
- The quantifiable data should represent several years of transactional history.
